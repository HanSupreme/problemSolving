# Problem Solving Java Code

Hi, 

To whomever is reading this, I will add a file of Java Code along with the answer(s). 

Anyone is welcomed to contribute and add code if there is a much simpler version way to solve it. 

My only request is to NOT delete the original solution and to add the contributed solution below the previous code and with comments please; so that users (whatever level they may be in) can read and understand the way it was solved.

Thank you and happy coding!
